Since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, Wharton research finds, depositors have moved their money around faster due to factors including the financial health of their banks, interest rates, ease in money transfers, and service quality. Why does this matter? Banks rely on low-cost and stable deposits, which make up more than 80% of the liabilities of an average U.S. bank. They face a bit of a catch-22 in that faster transfers ‚Äì a positive for consumers ‚Äì also mean that more money is moved outwards to other banks. hashtag # banking   hashtag # banks",3,0,Image,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/sync/v2/D4D10AQHByQJsol-jZg/image-shrink_160/image-shrink_160/0/1716131103477?e=1738184400&v=beta&t=5l39MEuZxm5DDUSvoJTs8IIuRp6Bpk77etUCGEnAlkk,No videos,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=banking&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7197975552157220864; https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=banks&highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7197975552157220864,loyal bank fall Silicon Valley Bank Wharton research finds depositors moved money faster due factors including financial health banks interest rates ease money transfers service quality matter Banks rely cost stable deposits liabilities average bank face bit catch faster transfers positive consumers money moved outwards banks banking banks,0.09423400673400673,Neutral,0.10
197,"10/16/24, 12:48PM (EST)","Being described as ""self-reliant"" often conveys an inability to ask for help from others. But that perception is based on the idea of self-reliant men, with whom the trait is stereotypically associated, says   The Wharton School   professor   Rebecca Schaumberg . Schaumberg's research into perceptions of leaders in the workplace found that self-reliance connotes a different meaning for female leaders; they are viewed as similarly competent, but more communal compared to self-reliant male leaders. ""You describe a man as highly self-reliant, and people infer that he‚Äôs not going to be very social, he‚Äôs not going to be very warm, he‚Äôs going to be resistant to working with others,"" Schaumberg shared on our Ripple Effect podcast. ""They just don‚Äôt make that same inference when you describe a woman as self-reliant."" ""What this revealed to me is often these traits change their meaning and what they convey based on who is possessing that trait,"" she added.

But if your goals are too small, this effort can backfire.   ‚ÄúSubgoals can enhance progress,‚Äù Milkman told Knowledge at Wharton earlier this year. ‚ÄúHowever, as these subgoals become increasingly small, they also become less adaptable.

A study from Wharton Professor Huan Tang,   Bo Bian   ( The University of British Columbia ), and   Xinchen Ma   ( The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)   found that Apple‚Äôs mandate led to a 15% decrease in revenue from user subscriptions and in-app purchases, compared to their counterpart apps available on   Google Play .   On the consumer side, Professor Tang found that 80% of data items collected are used for purposes unrelated to the functionality of an app, pushing forward transparency of data collection.
