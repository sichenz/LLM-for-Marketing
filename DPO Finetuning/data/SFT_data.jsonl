Retirees are better off keeping their savings in 401(k) plans instead of moving them to IRAs, especially lower-income people with limited financial literacy, according to research from finance professor   Olivia S Mitchell . 2. \"There are still many versions of inequality, and the gaps have the potential to widen without any interventions,‚Äù management professor   Stephanie Creary   shared at the inaugural Relationships Across Differences Roundtable. 3. Happiness continues to rise with income ‚Äî even beyond incomes of $500,000 or more, according to a new study from senior fellow   Matt Killingsworth .   4. As a newly promoted manager, accept that social relationships with your peers must change, says management professor   Peter Cappelli . Communicate your expectations clearly, give timely, objective feedback, and set boundaries with your direct reports. 5. ‚ÄúOnce you become a bigger organization, you end up too homogenous, and you have a lot of groupthink, and it becomes harder to change and innovate,‚Äù management professor   Adam Grant   said during a conversation with Malcolm Gladwell."}]}
